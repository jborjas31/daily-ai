**Impact**: High - users could lose important recurring tasks permanently  

**Implementation Need**:
- "Are you sure you want to delete this recurring task?" prompts
- "Delete all future instances?" confirmation for recurring task edits
- "Permanently delete this task template?" for soft-deleted task removal
- Confirmation for bulk operations
#### User feedback:
- I accept this implementation.

**Suggested Location**: Add to unified time block editor modal as separate confirmation step

---

### 2. **Loading States**
**Status**: Missing  
**Issue**: No visual feedback during network operations  
**Risk**: User confusion during slow Firebase operations, multiple clicks, perceived app freezing  
**Impact**: High - poor user experience during network delays  

**Implementation Need**:
- Loading spinners for save operations
- Progress indicators for sync operations
- Disabled button states during processing
- "Saving..." text feedback
- Network status indicators (online/offline/syncing)
#### User feedback:
- I accept this implementation.

**Suggested Location**: Add to all Firebase interaction points, header status area

---

### 3. **Task Notes/Descriptions**
**Status**: Missing  
**Issue**: Tasks only have names, no detailed descriptions or context

#### User feedback:
- I accept this implementation but with the caveat of don't overcomplicate this.

**Data Structure Addition**:
```json
{
  "taskName": "string",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "notes": "string (optional)"
}
```

### 5. **Undo/Redo Functionality**
**Status**: Missing  
**Issue**: No way to reverse accidental actions  
**Risk**: User frustration with irreversible mistakes  
**Impact**: Medium - quality of life improvement  

**Implementation Need**:
- Undo for task completion/incompletion
- Undo for task deletion (restore from soft delete)
- Undo for task editing changes
- Undo for skip/postpone actions
- Toast notifications with "Undo" button
- 10-second undo window
#### User feedback:
- I don't accept this implementation.

**Technical Consideration**: Requires action history tracking in application state

---

### 6. **Keyboard Navigation**
**Status**: Missing  
**Issue**: No keyboard shortcuts or accessibility support specified  
**Risk**: Poor accessibility compliance, reduced power user efficiency  
**Impact**: Medium - accessibility and usability concern  

**Implementation Need**:
- Tab navigation through interface
- Enter/Escape for modal interactions
- Arrow keys for timeline navigation
- Spacebar for task completion toggle
- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., 'n' for new task, 't' for today)
- Screen reader compatibility
- ARIA labels and roles
#### User feedback:
- don't implement this for now. too complicated.

**Accessibility Standards**: Should meet WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

## üìù **Nice-to-Have Missing Features**

### 7. **Bulk Operations**
**Status**: Missing  
**Issue**: No multi-select functionality for mass actions  
**Risk**: Inefficient task management for large numbers of tasks  
**Impact**: Low-Medium - convenience feature  

**Implementation Need**:
- Multi-select checkboxes in Task Library
- Bulk complete/incomplete
- Bulk delete/restore
- Bulk edit (change time window, priority)
- "Select all" functionality
- Bulk skip for today
#### User feedback:
- don't implement this for now. too complicated.

**UI Pattern**: Checkbox selection mode with action bar

---

### 8. **Data Import**
**Status**: Missing (Export mentioned, no import)  
**Issue**: No way to import tasks from other systems or restore from backup  
**Risk**: Limited migration capability, difficult backup restoration  
**Impact**: Low - mainly affects initial setup and disaster recovery  

**Implementation Need**:
- Import from CSV/JSON files
- Import from other task management systems
- Restore from app's own export format
- Validation and error handling for import data
- Preview import before applying
#### User feedback:
- don't implement this for now. too complicated.

**File Formats**: CSV, JSON, potentially iCal integration

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. **Review and prioritize** these missing features based on user needs
2. **Update README.md** with accepted high-priority features
3. **Modify development phases** to include essential missing features
4. **Consider accessibility requirements** for broader usability
5. **Plan post-MVP roadmap** for medium and low priority features

The core app specification is solid and ready for development. These missing features represent opportunities to enhance user experience and app robustness rather than fundamental gaps that would block implementation.
