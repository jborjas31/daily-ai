# Analysis of Outdated Project Files

Based on a review of the project, the following files contain outdated information and do not accurately reflect that Phases 1 and 2 are complete. Updating these will prevent future confusion for developers and AI assistants.

## Outdated Files:

*   **`tests/TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: This file provides outdated testing instructions that refer to Phase 2A as if it's currently in progress. The entire testing methodology needs to be updated.
*   **`tests/README.md`**: The README for the tests describes the old, manual testing process and suggests that automated testing might be implemented in the future. This should be updated to reflect the new testing strategy.
*   **`tests/test-templates.js`**: This test file contains a log message indicating that a step in Phase 2A is ready for completion, which is obsolete. This file should be removed and replaced by a modern testing framework.
*   **`docs/REQUIREMENTS_QA.md`**: This document contains outdated language such as "Almost ready for Phase 1 development!" which is no longer true.
*   **`docs/FINAL_CRITICAL_GAPS_AUDIT.md`**: This audit document refers to actions that need to be taken "before starting Phase 1 development," which is obsolete.
*   **`docs/CRITICAL_GAPS.md`**: This document uses the phrase "Before MVP Launch" in a way that suggests it's a future event, which is no longer the case.
*   **`docs/CRITICAL_FIXES_ACTION_PLAN.md`**: This file is significantly outdated, as it lists all critical fixes with a "Pending" status.

These files should be updated or archived to ensure the project documentation accurately reflects the current development status.
