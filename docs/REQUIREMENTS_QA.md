# Questions for Web App Development

## Critical Questions Requiring Clarification

The instructions.md file is comprehensive and well-structured, but several key specifications need clarification before development:

### **1. Authentication Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** Firebase Auth doesn't natively support username/password authentication - it uses email/password
- **Question:** Should we implement custom authentication with Firestore user records, or modify the requirement to use email/password?
#### Answer: 
- use email/password

### **2. Time Window Definitions (HIGH PRIORITY)**  
- **Issue:** "morning", "afternoon", "evening" timeWindows lack specific hour ranges
- **Question:** What are the exact time boundaries?
  - Morning: 6:00-12:00?
  - Afternoon: 12:00-18:00? 
  - Evening: 18:00-23:00?
#### Answer:
  - Morning: 6:00-12:00 
  - Afternoon: 12:00-18:00
  - Evening: 18:00-23:00

### **3a. Time Window Boundary Handling (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** How to classify tasks that span multiple time windows (e.g., 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM)?
- **Question:** Should the task be classified as morning, afternoon, or split between both?
#### Answer:
- Use start time to determine time window classification
- Example: 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM = morning task (starts in morning window)
- Rationale: Simple, intuitive rule that's consistent for scheduling engine

### **4. Recurrence Rule Structure (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** `recurrenceRule` field specified as "object" with no structure
- **Question:** What should the recurrence object contain?
  - Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
  - Interval (every 2 weeks, etc.)
  - End date or occurrence count
  - Days of week for weekly tasks
#### Answer:
- recurrence object should contain:
  - Frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
  - Interval (every 2 weeks, etc.)
  - End date or occurrence count
  - Days of week for weekly tasks

### **5. Navigation Design (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** "simple navigation (tabs or menu)" is ambiguous
- **Question:** Preferred navigation style for mobile/desktop?
#### Answer: 
- preferred navigation is menu

### **6. Real-Time Update Frequency (MEDIUM PRIORITY)** 
- **Issue:** "every minute" may not provide smooth red timeline indicator movement
- **Question:** Should the red line update more frequently (every 10-30 seconds) for smoother movement?
#### Answer:
- red line should update every 30 seconds

### **7. Browser Storage Strategy (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** Multiple storage mentions (browser storage, local queue, offline cache)
- **Question:** Preferred storage mechanism - localStorage, sessionStorage, or IndexedDB?
#### Answer:
- Primary: IndexedDB for robust offline data storage and caching
- Fallback: localStorage with data size limit warning when IndexedDB fails
- This ensures functionality in all environments with graceful degradation

### **8. Default Settings (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Question:** What are the default values for new users?
  - Default sleep duration: 8 hours?
  - Default wake time: 7:00 AM?
  - Default sleep time: 11:00 PM?
#### Answer:
  - Default sleep duration: 7.5 hours
  - Default wake time: 6:30 AM
  - Default sleep time: 23:00

### **9. Sync Conflict Resolution (LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Question:** How to handle conflicts when offline changes conflict with server changes?
#### Answer:
- Use last-write-wins conflict resolution when syncing offline changes
- Simple and effective for single-user app

### **10. Performance Constraints (LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Question:** Any specific performance requirements or browser compatibility needs?
#### Answer:
- web app should not lag as much as possible
